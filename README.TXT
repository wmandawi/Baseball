If you have a partner state how many times you partnered with each 
other before? (Only 3 or less is a valid answer.)

Hours to complete assignment (optional):15



/******************************************************************************
 *  Explain concisely how you built the FlowNetwork from the input file.
 *****************************************************************************/
I used the insetructions given to build it. It takes all the input
and have two hashmaps to convert from string to int and vice versa.

 *  Consider the sports league defined in teams12.txt. Explain in
 *  nontechnical terms (using the results of certificate of elimination
 *  and grade-school arithmetic) why Japan is mathematically
 *  eliminated.
 *****************************************************************************/
With best luch Japan finishes the season with 2+4=6 wins. the subset of teams
R = {P,R,B,Ir,It,C,A,U,S,E,Ch} have 6+5+5+5+4+4+3+3+1+1=37 wins, there are also
4+5+5+4+5+5+5+4+5+4+4=50remaining so the teams in R will win at least 87/11 =
7 games. regardless of the outcome one team will win 7 games which is more than 
6. Thus, Japan is eliminated.

I managed to make my program tell if its not eliminated and if the elimination 
is trivial but if its a non trivial elimination then my program returns that 
it is not eliminated.
